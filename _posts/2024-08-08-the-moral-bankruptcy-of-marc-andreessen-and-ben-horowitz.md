title: The moral bankruptcy of Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz

short_description: '"In venture capital, you are what you fund. Andreessen and
  Horowitz understand this, even embody it. But they aren’t just funding the
  issues they discuss on their podcast; they are funding Trump and Vance. That
  means those donations are anti-abortion, anti-immigration, and possibly even
  anti-democracy because that is what the Trump / Vance ticket stands for. These
  are not subsidiary issues: these are now what two of Silicon Valley’s most
  prominent figures now stand for, too."'
