short_description: "While exuberance around a host of new technologies from the
  past dec­ade—like self-driving cars, delivery apps, home flipping, and
  augmented reality—recedes, VCs are working to inflate new bubbles around
  other, much-hyped technologies, such as the Metaverse and Web3, which is a
  part of the wider excitement around blockchain technologies. The shelf life of
  ebullience for the Metaverse and Web3 is, of course, unclear, but a much more
  important question is this one: how do such technology bubbles affect the
  broader economy and society?"
