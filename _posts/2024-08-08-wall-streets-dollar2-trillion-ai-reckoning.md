short_description: '"This steep decline in the Magnificent Seven stocks might
  seem like a clear signal that Wall Street has already become disenchanted with
  AI, that the thesis it would revolutionize industries and create a massive
  productivity boom anytime soon may not be such a sure thing. And that is true
  — at least to a point."'
