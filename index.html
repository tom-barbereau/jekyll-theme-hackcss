    <h1>Dr. Tom (Josua) Barbereau</h1>

    <p>
    I research the sociology and construction of information technology. I'm a scientist specialist at the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (<a target="_blank" href="tno.nl">TNO</a>) as part of the unit on ICT, Strategy, and Policy. 
    </p>
    <p>
    I earned my PhD in information systems management from the University of Luxembourg (Thesis: <a target="_blank" href="https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/58926">Politics, Power, and Information Systems</a>). My research principally focused on three technologies – blockchain, identity systems, and the metaverse – which I approach in a critical manner. I spent time at the Institute for Information Law (IViR), University of Amsterdam to work on questions of technology, governance, and the law. I hold an MSc in Science & Technology Studies from the University of Edinburgh and a BA in Liberal Arts & Sciences from the University of Groningen.

    Having successfully collaborated and published with lawyers, mathematicians, and computer scientists, my strength lies in cross-disciplinary collaboration, to find logical relations between topics, and to untangle socio-technological controversies. Amongst other outlets, I contributed impactful research featured in <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102251">Technology in Society</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00612-z">Philosophy & Technology</a> </li>, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2023.101873">Government Information Quarterly</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105829">Computer Law and Security Review</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649318">Academy for Computing Machinery</a> amongst other international conferences and contributions to edited books. You can find my most up-to-date portfolio of academic publications on <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvsfsEMAAAAJ&hl=en">GoogleScholar</a>.

    Regularly, I talk at academic conference, lecture students, or speak at professional events. As per occassion, I address the different audiences at different levels of complexity. Below is a selection of these:
    <ul>
  <li>Entrepreneurship powered by blockchain: Lecture at the Kyoto University of Advanced Science | Kyoto, Japan (January, 2024)</li>
  <li>Beyond A Fistful of Tumblers: Talk at the International Conference on Information Systems | Hyderabad, India (December, 2023)</li>
  <li>The Decentralised Web as the Cause of Organisations: Keynote at closing conference of the ERC Blockchain & Society Policy Research Lab, Governance by technology – the revolution will not be decentralized? | Amsterdam, The Netherlands (July, 2023)</li>
  <li>On Metaverses: Between Buzz and Opportunity: Talk at Stuttgart Stock Exchange's Scientific Advisory Board | Stuttgart, Germany (April, 2023)</li>

  Finally, in the style of <a target=_blank" href="https://www.jathansadowski.com/">Jathan Sadowski</a>, I too wrote up a personal statement on how I think about the politics and power of technology. Like for Jathan, I believe it of value given that as social scientist I am frequently asked why I study technology in the first place and, more provocatively, what my contribution might even be as a `non-technical' guy. You can read this personal statement on my blog.
