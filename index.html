    <h1>About me</h1>

    <p>
    I research the sociology and construction of information technology. I'm a scientist specialist at the Dutch Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (<a target="_blank" href="tno.nl">TNO</a>) as part of the unit on ICT, Strategy, and Policy.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>

    <p>
    I earned my PhD in information systems management from the University of Luxembourg (Thesis: <a target="_blank" href="https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/58926">Politics, Power, and Information Systems</a>) as part of the Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.uni.lu/snt-en/">SnT</a>). My research principally focused on three technologies – blockchain, identity systems, and the metaverse – which I approach in a critical manner. As visiting researcher, I spent time at the Institute for Information Law (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.ivir.nl/">IViR</a>), University of Amsterdam to work on questions of technology, governance, and the law. I hold an MSc in Science & Technology Studies from the University of Edinburgh and a BA in Liberal Arts & Sciences from the University of Groningen.

    Having successfully collaborated and published with lawyers, mathematicians, and computer scientists, my strength lies in cross-disciplinary collaboration, to find logical relations between topics, and to untangle socio-technological controversies. I published impactful research in <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2023.102251">Technology in Society</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00612-z">Philosophy & Technology</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.giq.2023.101873">Government Information Quarterly</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.clsr.2023.105829">Computer Law and Security Review</a>, and the <a target="_blank" href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3649318">Academy for Computing Machinery</a> amongst other international conferences and edited books. You can find my most up-to-date portfolio on <a target="_blank" href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qvsfsEMAAAAJ&hl=en">GoogleScholar</a>.

    Regularly, I talk at academic conference, lecture students, or speak at professional events. As per occassion, I address the different audiences at different levels of complexity. You can check out a list of them <a target=_blank" href="https://tom-barbereau.github.io/talks">here</a>.

  Finally, in the style of <a target=_blank" href="https://www.jathansadowski.com/">Jathan Sadowski</a>, I too wrote up a personal statement on how I think about the politics and power of technology. Like for Jathan, I believe it of value given that as social scientist I am frequently asked why I study technology in the first place and, more provocatively, what my contribution might even be as a `non-technical' guy. You can read this statement on my blog.
